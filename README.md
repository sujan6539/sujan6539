## Projects 🚧

I've embarked on numerous exciting projects that challenge my abilities and allow me to experiment with cutting-edge technologies. Here are a few highlights:

### Project 1: 🌟 Spiderhead App

If you haven't watched Spiderhead, a netflix movie, you must! I know you're not here for a mediocre movie recommendation, atleast from the review standpoint, but trust me you will start to question all human and otherwise experiments that has been going on in the world for humanity.

Keeping that aside, I got really interested in building Spiderhead UI, so I worked on a mock App.

### Project 2: 🤖 Mood Bar

Do you get that same feeling sometimes? You want to cook/order something spicy, or salty, or umami but you're just scrolling though endless menu items/recipe. You're not by yourself.

So, I created a MoodBar that shows 5 columns representing 5 main tastes and the expectation is that depending on the level of different tastes a user selects, app recommends recipe to the user. This is work in progress and UI only.
